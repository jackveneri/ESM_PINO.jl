# ESM_PINO

Documentation for [ESM_PINO](https://github.com/jackveneri/ESM_PINO.jl).

The SFNO components are empty-defined in the main module and work through extensions by loading two different backends for the Spherical Harmonics transforms: QG3.jl (supports Zygote for automatic differentiation), and SpeedyWeather.jl (still work in progress)
